# Recursive Fibonacci Sequence in MIPS Assembly

### Purpose:  
The program prints out the fibonacci sequence to the nth term, in reverse 
of the user's inputted integer. It also calculates the sum of the fibonacci
terms to the nth term, and does it all recursively through the same 
fibonacci procedure.

### Input:    
The user inputs an integer between 0 and 44 (inclusive). This integer will 
be the nth term that the fibonacci sequence will count to. 

### Output:   
The program will output the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term that the
user inputted in reverse, with a comma separated between each of them. 
After that, it will output the sum of the fibonacci sequence values up to
the nth term.
